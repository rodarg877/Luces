Thank you for purchasing the Black Cherry Firewood 01 Pack! 

The package is the Assets>B3DArt>FirewoodBC01 folder. 

Prefabs in the main folder.
	-The R_ prefabs are rigidbody versions of the assets that can use physics. 

Showcase scene in the main folder.

Materials in the main folder

Additional Pipelines folder includes the URP & BIRP packages in case you are using one of those instead of HDRP. Default package is setup for HDRP but if not using HDRP you can unpack the version you are using(URP for Universal 3D, BIRP for Built-in Render Pipeline) and import included files.

FBX files in Imports.
	-The _COL models are for the colliders. Already applied in the Mesh Collider Component for their respective prefabs.

Textures in the Textures folder.
	-Base Textures are 4K but there is an 8K folder for the 8K Albedo & Normal, which the material is using by default. 
	 To save space you can apply the 4K Albedo & Normal to the material and delete the 8K folder.

The Demo scene uses additional files located in Assets>B3DArt>_Extra. Included files used for the demo scene are:
	-CC0 licensed Autumn Forest 02 HDRI from PolyHaven. Author is Andreas Mischok. Thank you to PolyHaven and the author for their awesome work!
	-ForestRootsGround01, a material scan of mine. Included is the 4K version
	-B3D_SkyandFogSettingsProfile_Forest, HDRP volume for the demo
